re that our team successfully participated in IBM DATATHON 24! We worked on an innovative Bird Migration Tracking System, combining machine learning and web development to track migration details.

üîç Our solution provides real-time insights into bird migration patterns and helps analyze environmental impact, ensuring a sustainable future for our planet's ecosystems.

üí° Features include:

Website Interface: A user-friendly platform to explore migration data.
ML Model: Predicts bird migration trends using AI to contribute to wildlife conservation.
Special thanks to my amazing teammates for their dedication and collaboration:

Bird Migration Tracking System
Project Overview
This project was developed for IBM DATATHON 24 to tackle environmental sustainability through technology. We built a comprehensive Bird Migration Tracking System that uses machine learning to predict migration patterns, supported by a user-friendly website interface for real-time data access.

Features
Migration Prediction Model:

Developed with a machine learning algorithm to predict and analyze bird migration patterns over time.
Real-time insights help in understanding migration trends and contributing to conservation efforts.
Website Interface:

Displays migration data in an easy-to-navigate format.
Users can explore detailed information on various bird species and their migratory behavior.
Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express
Machine Learning: Python (scikit-learn)
Database: PostgreSQL
APIs: RESTful APIs for data interaction
