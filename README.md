Bird Migration Tracking System


Overview
This project was developed as part of IBM DATATHON 24, focusing on leveraging technology for environmental sustainability. Our solution is a comprehensive Bird Migration Tracking System that integrates a machine learning model with a user-friendly website to track and predict bird migration patterns. The system provides real-time insights into migratory behaviors, helping contribute to conservation efforts and ecosystem preservation.

Features
Machine Learning Model:

Predicts bird migration patterns using historical data and AI algorithms.
Built to analyze large datasets and provide actionable insights for wildlife conservation.
Web Interface:

Displays bird migration details in an interactive and accessible way.
Offers real-time data visualization, helping users track migration routes and trends.
User-friendly platform designed for researchers, environmentalists, and wildlife enthusiasts.
Sustainability Impact:

Helps analyze the environmental impact of migration patterns and climate change on bird species.
Supports initiatives for biodiversity preservation.

Usage
Users can view bird migration routes and species information through the website interface.
The ML model processes historical data and predicts migration trends that are displayed on the platform.
The system provides interactive maps for visualizing migration paths.
Dataset
The dataset used includes bird migration data collected over several years, with attributes such as species, date, location, and flight patterns.
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were implemented using Pandas for optimal performance.
